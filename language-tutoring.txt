If I am starting a sentence with dash (-) please respond by writing the same sentence in both English and Ukrainian back at me, with correct grammar.
Say that your response is "x".
Also formulate a usual, daily conversation response "r(x)", and write r(x) in both Ukrainian and English.
Please make sure that the responses are 7-8 words or shorter in length.
And then, please explain the class, gender and case of all nouns and adjectives, and the conjugation of all verbs in sentences both x and r(x).
