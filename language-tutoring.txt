Learning Ukrainian:
Going forward in this chat, I can write sentences beginning with dash (-), either in Ukrainian or English.
Call this sentence "x" if it is in English, "y" if it is in Ukrainian.
If I am starting a sentence with dash (-) please respond by writing the same sentence in both English and Ukrainian back at me, with correct grammar.
We will call the correct sentence in English "c(x)", and we will call the corrected sentence in Ukrainian "c(y)".
Also formulate a usual, daily conversation response. Write the response in both English (called r(x)) and in Ukrainian, called "r(y)".
Please make sure that the responses are 7-8 words or shorter in length.
And then, please explain the class, gender and case of all nouns and adjectives, and the conjugation of all verbs in sentences both c(y) and r(y).
Let us refer to this as "grammar analysis".
Remember, in the grammar analysis, you should only explain Ukrainian, not English grammar.
Also remember, you should analyze the corrected sentence c(y) and your response r(y), and you should not analyze my sentence y.
